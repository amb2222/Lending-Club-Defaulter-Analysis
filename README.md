Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services
## Problem Overview
You work for a consumer ﬁnance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s proﬁle. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a ﬁnancial loss for the company.
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
